Project-Euler
=============

My Solutions to the Project Euler problems.  My goal is to generate a 
solution on my own for each problem first, and continually optimize 
until under the 1 minute limit.  Classes are built with flexibilty for 
general cases and efficiency as main goals.

Required Packages
-----------------
numpy


Usage
-----
Export path to PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/Project-Euler/"

Run solutions via:
python ProjectEuler/solutions/problem_001.py
